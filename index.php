    <p>My name is Luke Ogburn, and I'm a full stack web developer. I'm going to
       JMU to major in Computer Science, and I'm going to study abroad if I can.
       I'm still mostly self taught, but I'm certainly learning a lot through JMU.<br>
        I have recently started to use <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/logburn>github</a>,

    <p>The Chinese Communist Party has <a href=https://transitjam.com/2020/06/30/national-security-law-e>
       freedom to Hong Kong. For that reason, I find it necessary to use this medium to express the incr>
       for the CCP and declare that I fully support any efforts to end their rule in China, including
       the restoration of the rightful autonomy of Hong Kong. <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/>
