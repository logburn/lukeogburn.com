    <h2>Programmer</h2>
    <p>I've used this website to practice my web development skills for about four years now. I have become a full-stack developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and SQL Database design/management. I can certainly use Java and C but they are not my go to languages. I'm also trying to learn Kotlin and Rust to develop open source applications.</p>

    <h2>Animals</h2>
    <p>I think that goats are the dogs of the farm and ducks are the dogs of the air. I believe that having animals in your life is essential to mental health, so naturally I am looking forward to owning my own pets: Three goats, two dogs, and a duck.</p>
