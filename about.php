    <h2>Programmer</h2>
    <p>I've used this website to practice my web development skills for about three years now. I have become a full-stack developer with expertise in: HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and SQL Database design/management. While I have some experience using C++, Java, Bash, and Python, I have not developed any full applications with them.</p>

    <h2>Student</h2>
    <p>I am a freshman in college, majoring in both CS and ISAT. I'm interested in the field of technology but I'm not sure exactly what I want to do with it - so I'm double majoring to keep my doors open.</p>

    <h2>Animals</h2>
    <p>I think that goats are the dogs of the farm and ducks are the dogs of the air. I believe that having animals in your life is essential to mental health, so naturally I am looking forward to owning my own pets: Three goats, two dogs, and a duck.</p>
